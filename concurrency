    * I told a little white lie earlier, when I said that everything happens in
      one OS process.

    * Go actually provides true concurrency. It multiplexes many goroutines
      onto a few OS processes with a single shared address space (i.e.
      threads).

    * Implementation detail: Go's current scheduler is simple and dumb; you
      have to tell it how many processes it can use. The default is 1.

      In the future, they will write a smarter scheduler that will do this
      automatically.
