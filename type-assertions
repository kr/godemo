                                Type Assertions

    * Looks like this:

        <expr>.(<type>)

    * Given:

        x := interface{}(1) // dynamic type is int; static type is interface{}

    * With "comma ok" idiom:

        i, ok := x.(int) // static type is int; i is 0 if !ok

      Commonly seen as:

        if i, ok := x.(int); ok {
            // work with i
        }

    * Plain:

        i := x.(int) // static type is int; could panic
