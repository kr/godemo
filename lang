    * System programming language (like C and C++) -- OS level programming,
      kernel syscalls, designed for writing system software (like web servers,
      databases, compilers, etc). Gives control over memory layout of
      structures. Also provides a Unix-style interface to the OS.

    * Relatives: C, Alef, Limbo, Squeak (not Squeak Smalltalk), Newsqueak, also
      some ideas from Pascal.

    * Memory safety, garbage collection, lambda forms and closures, array,
      slice and map (dictionary).

    * Go, like Unix, doesn't try to prevent you from doing stupid things,
      because that would also prevent you from doing clever things.

    * Shared address space, mutexes, etc.

    * Obvious syntax...
