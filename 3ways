                   to deal with it.

                  "Isolation, immutability and locking. You
                   only need one."[0]


    * Locking is often discouraged as being too hard to use properly, but once
      in a while it's the right (i.e. easiest) approach.

    * Erlang (last I heard) forces you to use both immutability *and*
      isolation. This makes it slower than it needs to be.

    * Go makes isolation convenient, but allows you to use any of these three
      as you see fit.

    * Go, like Unix, doesn't try to prevent you from doing stupid things,
      because that would also prevent you from doing clever things.
