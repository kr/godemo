                                     Types

    * Numbers (int, uint, byte, int64, etc), string

    * Arrays -- fixed size at compile time

    * Slices -- fixed size at run time

    * If you need dynamic resizing (like a Ruby Array), use the vector package.
      We'll look at this in a minute.

    * Maps

    * Pointers -- like in C, but no pointer arithmetic

    * Structs -- like in C

    * Interfaces -- like in Java, *except* you don't explicitly declare that
      you implement an interface.
