    * Go types don't list supported interfaces explicitly. This small change
      makes the system have a totally different feel.

    * Each Java class has to list out all interfaces. This is a strong
      motivator to have few interfaces total. So each interface tends to be
      bigger.

    * Big, heavyweight interfaces != happy programmers.

    * Go is the opposite. Typical Go interface has just one method in it. Lots
      of interfaces all over the place. Keeps the code flexible and easy to
      work with.

    * Also, you can define an interface after a type has already been defined,
      without having to patch that type's definition. Good for stuff you can't
      easily patch, like the standard lib.
