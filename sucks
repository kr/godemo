What's wrong with static type checking?

    1. Writing out all those declarations.

    2. Gets in the way.

"All static type checking sucks. This one just sucks less."[0]

    * Go tries to reduce stuttering (foo.Foo* myFoo = new(foo.Foo)):

        var x int = 0    ==>    x := 0

      Helps a bit with #1 above.

    * Embedding/delegation rather than inheritance simplifies things.

    * Interfaces help with #2 above...
